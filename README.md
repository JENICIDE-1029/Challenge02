# Challenge2

## Description

This challenge was focused on variouuuss thhings but for the most part it consisted of applying what we've learned in this bootcamp in CSS, HTML, and a little bit of javascript while also applying best practices to keep everything adaptable to different viewports. Overall this project is the beginning of what will become my completed portfolio that i will show off to future employers of my work. This project was a lot of fun and being able to implement a mobile-first (aka progressive advancement) practice to this website helped me a LOT, along with drawing out a wireframe for how each viewport would look like.
